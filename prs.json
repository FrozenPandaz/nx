Plugins have a publish target by default even when created in an existing workspace (which likely has its own publish flow)\r\n- The migration runs even if the only element in the `generators`

migrator to just check if Storybook is installed in the workspace.\r\nBefore, it would check if Storybook is already in v7. The thing here is that during the previous step of the migration, during packageJsonUpdates, Nx has already set Storybook to version 7, if Storybook exists in the workspace.\r\nSo, it makes no sense here to check if the version is 7, because it will always be. The `migrate-7` generator will handle the logic of whether it needs to actually run any migrations or not.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrwl/nx/issues/16431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrwl/nx/issues/16431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrwl/nx/issues/16404","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrwl/nx","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrwl/nx/issues/16404/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrwl/nx/issues/16404/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrwl/nx/issues/16404/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/16404","id":1674960226,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBfbSFM5OrON0","number":16404,"title":"fix(misc): handle packages rescope in nx init flows","user":{"login":"leosvelperez","id":12051310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDUxMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12051310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez","html_url":"https://github.com/leosvelperez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":{"login":"leosvelperez","id":12051310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDUxMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12051310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez","html_url":"https://github.com/leosvelperez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"leosvelperez","id":12051310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDUxMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12051310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez","html_url":"https://github.com/leosvelperez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leosvelperez/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2023-04-19T13:57:18Z","updated_at":"2023-04-26T00:06:53Z","closed_at":"2023-04-20T12:50:38Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":"resolved","draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nrwl/nx/pulls/16404","html_url":"https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/16404","diff_url":"https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/16404.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/16404.patch","merged_at":"2023-04-20T12:50:38Z"},"body":"<!-- Please make sure you have read the submission guidelines before posting an PR -->\r\n<!-- https://github.com/nrwl/nx/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-submitting-a-pr -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please make sure that your commit message follows our format -->\r\n<!-- Example: `fix(nx): must begin with lowercase` -->\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n<!-- This is the behavior we have today -->\r\n\r\nSome `nx init` flows reference the `@nrwl` scope and don't handle the new `@nx` scope.

`module: commonjs` in favor of using the config from `tsconfig.json`:\r\nhttps://github.com/nrwl/nx/commit/b2df83107639d78aa1c1524f887ae45abda7c3a8#diff-2851f63978cee5996bae7a52b7ce339437421238099e62883d06fd64f3672bd6L46-L48\r\n\r\nHowever due to the type of the config passed to `parseJsonConfigFileContent` being `any` a regression was introduced which passed an empty object as the compiler options instead of the actual compiler options.\r\n\r\nWhen testing the fix on our application we ran into further issues due to the `jsx` + `lib` options being set in the custom workspace rules `tsconfig` so I added a fix for that as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!-- This is the behavior we should expect with the changes in this PR -->\r\n\r\nLinting using custom workspace rules in webstorm works\r\n\r\n## Related

migrations that were recently rewritten using the Nx DevKit still have their `cli` type as `ng`.\r\n\r\nThe migration installing the required peer deps uses the `@angular/cli` package to determine the version to use for those packages, but we don't bump the `@angular/cli` version automatically. We only update the `@angular/cli` package version in migration generators that run after the migration installing the peer deps. As such, an old version of the `@angular/cli` package is picked up.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!-- This is the behavior we should expect with the changes in this PR -->\r\n\r\nMigrations written with the Nx DevKit should have the `cli` type set as `nx`.\r\n\r\nThe migration installing the required peer deps sets the correct version of the Angular DevKit. Instead of using the `@angular/cli` package as reference, it should use the `@angular-devkit/build-angular`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issue(s)\r\n<!-- Please link the issue being fixed so it gets closed when

PR updates `@nx/js:swc` executor so it properly compiles with `jsc.paths` set in `.swcrc` for all environments. Another PR is failing because the compiled code has wrong path mapping. https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/16284\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n1. It looks like we're setting `jsc.baseUrl` with the wrong default. It should be `.` since `cwd` is set to the project root. That way, when mappings are used in output, it will be relative to the project root. Removing that whole logic and relying on users to set `baseUrl` seems more reliable. Also with local testing (macos, debian) it doesn't look like `baseUrl` is needed by swc at all (at least on latest version).\r\n2. Passing both `--no-swc` and `--config-file` together is causing wrong paths in output as well for some reason (able to replicate this in CI with just `npx swc` and not Nx, but not locally). Since we're passing the config file anyway, we don't need the `--no-swc` option to find the file.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please make sure you have read the submission guidelines before posting an PR -->\r\n<!--
